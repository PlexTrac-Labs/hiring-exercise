This is the `legacy` hiring exercise and is here for historic purposes.

# Project Purpose

As part of the PlexTrac application process, we would like to review an original application
developed by you. The purpose of this project is to assess your software development abilities,
including: your code design, code quality, productivity under time constraints, and ability to use
third-party libraries, frameworks, and services.

# Project Summary

Please build an application that allows users to interact with data from a third-party source.
Examples of third-party sources you may consider using include: Twitter’s API, IEX Trading API,
OpenWeather API, and NASA’s API. But please, feel free to use any other data source you
would like to build an application that interests you. The application should also allow for user
interaction. How the user is able to interact with your application is up to your imagination.

## Minimum Requirements
- The application should be built using either an Angular, Vue, or React frontend (preferably
React)
- The application should be built using a Node.js backend to serve the frontend and handle
requests to the third-party service
- The application should use either Express or HAPI middleware to manage its API
(preferably HAPI)
- The application should include an automated testing suite that uses a common testing
library such as Jasmine, Jest, or Mocha.

## Bonus Requirements
- Use a modern UI/UX library such as Ant, Bootstrap, Angular Material, Vuetify, or Material-UI
- Include a server-side data store such as MongoDB, Couchbase, or Postgres (preferably
Couchbase)
- Include user auth (register, login, logout)
- Use Docker to containerize your application and run using docker-compose
- Include a CI/CD infrastructure using a common tool such as TeamCity, Travis CI, or Jenkins
- The application should be deployed and hosted on one of the major cloud platforms (i.e.
AWS, Azure, or GCP)

# Submission Instructions

Please commit and push your code to a GitHub repository. Once you have completed the
project, please email a link of the repository to sol@plextrac.com.
